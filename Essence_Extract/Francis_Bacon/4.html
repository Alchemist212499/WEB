                Under most circumstances, revenge is not toleratable as it is the vandalizer of the law. The act of revenge puts the victim even with his enemy while the act of forgiveness grants the man with glory. Because the wise man is well-aware that it is vain to dwell on the past when the present and the future are better places to be. And only the witted know better than to get tangled up with offenders who are not worthy of further attention. However, when it is beyond the limitation of laws to constrain the evil, or when the sinner sees the coming of their karma, the revenge makes more sense. Even though forgiveness is advocated when it comes to revenge, betrayal of friends is unforgivable. In the end, there is a pattern which suggests that Public revenges tend to be more fortunate while the counterpart stays the opposite.
