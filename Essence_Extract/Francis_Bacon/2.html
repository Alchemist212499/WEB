                Fear towards death showes weakness, and it is often enhanced by the imagination of death itself, along with elements of religion. Nevertheless, the mankind has its wingman to fight the intimidation of death. It should be noted that emotions, such as revenge, love, honour, grief and fear are the common ones that can be of spears and shields when it comes to facing death. There have been numerous stories that exhibited the fact that the approaching of death hardly alters the characteristic of a man himself, especially for the good-spirited heroes, they don't flinch at the presence of death. However, when death becomes overrated, its reputation tends to become even more intimidating than it actually is. Collectively speaking, devoting oneself to the course may be endowed with the power to ease the pain of death, and as for  the other way around, death would glorify the passed, while generously extinguishes the flame of envy.
